## Learning outcomes:

**After review, algorithms and data structures must provide knowledge in:**
- explain the structure and purpose of linear data structures (lists, queues, stack), tree structures (binary trees, search trees, balanced trees, binary heaps, B-trees), hash tables and network structures/graphs
- understand and explain the efficiency of algorithms, with special emphasis on asymptotic analysis
- explain the operation and efficiency of standard algorithms for storage, insertion, searching, deletion, sorting, traversal and backtracking, both as iterative and recursive variants


**It will also provide skills such as:**
- design, implement and apply data structures for different needs
- analyze, design, implement and apply fundamental and classic algorithms
- use both self-developed and readily available algorithms and data structures to solve complex and complicated problems

**And competence within:**
- has insight into fundamental and enduring principles within classical informatics, which will remain independent of machine platforms and programming languages
- master concepts and terminology that are used in wide circles in informatics worldwide
- can discuss in professional forums and give advice on the use of data structures and algorithms in various situations
- can convey the importance and necessity of using appropriate structures and effective algorithms
